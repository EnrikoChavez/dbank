# dbank
learning dapps: <br /> <br />
This repository is able to deploy a new ERC_20 standard token into an ethereum blockchain, and a smart contract (dbank) into the blockchain as well. <br />
The repo also can run the front end to interact with the deployed contracts. <br />

The purpose of this repo is to be able to gain a new token (DBC: Decentralized Bank Token) by keeping ethereum locked up on a smart contract inside a blockchain. The more ethereum is locked up per unit time, the more DBC token is minted and given to the user per unit time once the user withdraws the ethereum from the dbank contract. <br /> <br />

  ran using Gananche network, <br />
  deployed smart contracts using truffle suit, <br />
  deployed website locally with npm <br />
